🌟 Overview

This project demonstrates the Bisection Method, a simple and reliable numerical technique used to find the root of a nonlinear equation.
It includes both a Google Sheet (manual version) and a Python implementation (Google Colab) to help visualize and automate the method.\

✏️ Equation Used
f(x) = x³ - x - 2
This equation has one real root between 1 and 2, approximately x ≈ 1.521.

⚙️ Bisection Method Steps

Choose two initial points a and b where f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs.
Find the midpoint m = (a + b) / 2.
Evaluate f(m).
If f(a) × f(m) < 0, the root is between a and m, otherwise between m and b.
Repeat until the difference between a and b is very small or f(m) is almost 0.
