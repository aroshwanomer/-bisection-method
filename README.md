# Bisection Method Implementation

This repository contains implementations of the Bisection method for finding roots of equations.

## Contents

1. **Google Sheets Solution** - Interactive spreadsheet for manual calculation
2. **Python Implementation** - Colab-compatible code with visualization
3. **Mathematical Explanation** - Theory behind the method

## Equation
We solve: **f(x) = x³ - 2x - 5 = 0**

## Method
The bisection method repeatedly bisects an interval and selects the subinterval where the root must lie.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
Run the Python script in Google Colab or any Python environment to see the bisection method in action.
